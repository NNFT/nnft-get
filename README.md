  Natural Non-Fungible Tokens (NNFT).

These tokens inherit the properties of ordinary Non-fungible Tokens, but additionally have the following two properties:

1. The address of the token is uniquely determined by the object of origin of the token (for example, a text phrase).
2. The token has the property of self-determination.
